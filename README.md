Space Shooter Game
Welcome to the Space Shooter Game, a thrilling 2D arcade-style game developed using Python and Pygame. This game tests your reflexes as you navigate a spaceship, shoot down enemies, and dodge incoming obstacles. The project showcases advanced Python programming techniques, game development principles, and object-oriented design in Pygame.

Overview
This game is designed as a fully functional 2D shooter, where players control a spaceship in outer space, fighting waves of enemy spaceships. The game demonstrates the use of game loops, collision detection, sprite management, and more, leveraging the power of Pygame.

The goal of the project is to provide a fun and engaging experience while also illustrating the application of Python programming in game development. This project is a part of my broader work in Python and game design, aimed at showcasing my proficiency in game mechanics, object-oriented programming, and visual effects.

Features
Player-controlled spaceship: Smooth player movement in all directions.
Enemies and Obstacles: Dynamic enemy waves with increasing difficulty.
Shooting mechanics: Shoot bullets from the spaceship to destroy enemies.
Collision Detection: Real-time collision between bullets and enemies.
Health and Score System: Players lose health when hit by enemies, and gain score by destroying them.
Sound Effects: Immersive sound effects for shooting, explosions, and background music.
Game Over Screen: A detailed game over screen displaying the player's score and a restart option.
Power-ups (Optional): Potential for adding health packs or weapon upgrades.
Installation
To play the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/space_shooter.git
cd space_shooter
Install the required dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the game: After installing dependencies, launch the game by running:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
How to Play
Movement: Use the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to navigate the spaceship.
Shooting: Press the spacebar to fire bullets at enemies.
Objective: Survive as long as possible by shooting down enemies and avoiding collisions.
Game Over: The game ends when the player's health reaches zero, but you can restart by pressing the R key.
